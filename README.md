# Cascade

## What it does
Livestreams video from the Pi-Camera to a web server.

## Setup
On your Pi type:

> sudo bash <(curl -s -L https://git.io/vAN26)

This will set it up completely. The hostname is cascadepi.local. To see the feed (30 second delay), type in your web browser http://cascadepi.local or your Pi's IP address.
During setup, your Pi will reboot. It is completely normal.
